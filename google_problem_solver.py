#              Basically, you have 3 friends that want to go from one house A to a house B,
#              the distance between them is 300 KM, They have one bike that can take maximum of
#              2 of the friends at a time, and need a pilot.
#              When a person is walking it goes at 15 KM/h.
#              When a person is on the bike they go at 60 KM/h.
#              What's the lowest time it takes them to go from house A to house B.
# 
#              The result is in the video and is 9.28 Hours, or 9H:17M.
#              This problem is not very difficult to analyze analytically, but it exemplifies
#              how a person that can program can transform a analytical problem, that could be
#              even more complex, by encoding it's rules in a program to make a simulation of 
#              the problem. And by using the power/speed of the computer to make a Monte Carlo
#              simulation and determining the solution to the problem.
#              Although in this case is not a very difficult problem.
# 
#              I have used a similar strategy for my solution to the Monty Hall Problem:
#              The Monty Hall Problem In JAVA
#              https://github.com/joaocarvalhoopen/The_Monty_Hall_Problem_In_JAVA
#
#              In a professional setting, once I was once in a course on the first days of job and the
#              Big Boss enters the room with all of us. He looks to see how we were all doing, and he puts a 
#              difficult mathematical problem challenge in the white board, (I don't remember the details of
#              the challenge).
#              We were all newbies trying to impress and when we went home we all tried to do the
#              challenge, I was at the problem for several hours and couldn't figure it out.
#              But it was a contained problem that couldn't be easily brute force broken by hand,
#              but I figured that if I implemented it on a computer I could simulate it with all 
#              outcomes or if that didn't work i could try to optimize it by the Monte Carlo Method.
#              That night, I programmed it in Java and the next day I was the only one with a solution
#              to the problem. Not because I was smarter then the others, but because I knew a nice way
#              to use the tools that I had at my disposal, the computer.
# 
#              The reason that I have made this Repository and the Monty Hall Problem in Java, is to show
#              others this cool way of solving complex problems.
#              By Brute Forcing it with exhaustive searching, or by Monte Carlo simulation.
#              In either way, put the computer to do the heavy lifting, and use the fact that you know how to
#              program.
