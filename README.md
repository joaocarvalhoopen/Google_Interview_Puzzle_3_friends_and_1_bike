# Google Interview Puzzle 3 friends and 1 bike.
One more problem solved by Monte Carlo simulation.

## Description
This was a google interview question that is explained in the following link: <br>

Basically, you have 3 friends that want to go from one house A to a house B, the distance between them is 300 KM, They have one bike that can take maximum of2 of the friends at a time, and need a pilot.

* When a person is walking it goes at 15 KM/h.
* When a person is on the bike they go at 60 KM/h.
* What's the lowest time it takes them to go from house A to house B?


The result is in the video and is 9.28 Hours, or 9H:17M.
This problem is not very difficult to analyze analytically, but it exemplifies how a person that can program can transform a analytical problem, that could be even more complex, by encoding it's rules in a program to make a simulation of the problem. And by using the power/speed of the computer to make a Monte Carlo simulation and determining the solution to the problem. <br>
Although in this case is not a very difficult problem. <br>
<br>
I have used a similar strategy for my solution to the Monty Hall Problem <br>

In a professional setting, once I was once in a course on the first days of job and the "Big Boss" enters the room with all of us. He looks to see how we were all doing, and he puts a difficult mathematical problem challenge in the white board, (I don't remember the details of the challenge). <br>
We were all newbies trying to impress and when we went home we all tried to do the challenge, I was at the problem for several hours and couldn't figure it out. <br>
But it was a contained problem that couldn't be easily brute force broken by hand, but I figured that if I implemented it on a computer I could simulate it with all outcomes or if that didn't work i could try to optimize it by the Monte Carlo Method. <br>
That night, I programmed it in Java and the next day I was the only one with a solution to the problem. Not because I was smarter then the others, but because I knew a nice way to use the tools that I had at my disposal, the computer. <br>
<br>
The reason that I have made this Repository and the Monty Hall Problem in Java, is to show others this cool way of solving complex problems. <br>
By Brute Forcing it with exhaustive searching, or by Monte Carlo simulation. <br>
In either way, put the computer to do the heavy lifting, and use the fact that you know how to program. <br>
